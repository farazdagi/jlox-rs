# jlox-rs

The tree-walk interpreter for Lox language in Rust.

This is the first of two interpreters described in (absolutely astonishing and a MUST *buy* and
read) book [Crafting Interpreters](https://craftinginterpreters.com/) by Robert Nystrom.

The core idea is to follow the book implementation (including challenges\!) and try to come up with
an equally concise and fast implementation in Rust.

## Features

- [ ] Idiomatic and safe Rust code
- [ ] Implementation includes and passes full
  [original test suite](https://github.com/munificent/craftinginterpreters/tree/master/test)
  (ideally, without rewriting original tests in any way)
- [ ] Interactive REPL with intuitive error messages and history

## Progress

- [x] Basic scanner/lexer (Chapter 4)
