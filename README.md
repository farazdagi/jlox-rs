# jlox-rs
Tree-walk interpreter for Lox language in Rust.

This is the first of two interpreters described in (absolutely astonishing and MUST buy and read) book [Crafting Interpreters](https://craftinginterpreters.com/) by Robert Nystrom.

The idea is to follow the book implementation (including challenges) and try to come up with equally concise and performant implementation is safe Rust.
